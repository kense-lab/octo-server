# Journal: my-ai-team-sessions

## What was done

- Added the feature-gated `/v1/ai-team` API and durable agent/session records.
- Lazily provisions one dedicated parent group per `(space_id,user_uid,bot_id)`;
  each parent contains exactly the owner and their active User Bot, while each
  conversation is a thread with idempotent DB and WuKongIM provisioning.
- Routes ordinary user messages in a ready AI thread to the persisted Bot target
  and emits a stable full-channel runtime session key and input ID.
- Protects dedicated parents from ordinary group, manager, thread and Bot API
  mutations, while preserving authoritative Space-member lifecycle cleanup.
- Filters both the dedicated parent and its topic channels from ordinary group,
  recent-conversation and follow/sidebar results.
- Keeps the operator-owned global auto-archive setting unchanged and structurally
  exempts AI-session threads from the stale-thread archive worker.

## Structural learnings

- A dedicated AI container is a business purpose, not a new transport group type.
  Keeping `group_type` unchanged preserves WuKongIM protocol behavior while the
  server-owned `purpose` field drives ACL and visibility policy.
- Hiding only the parent is insufficient: WuKongIM exposes thread conversations as
  independent type-5 channel IDs, so recent/follow filtering must normalize each
  topic back to its parent before applying the purpose filter.
- The unique association constraint is necessary but not sufficient. Serializing
  the association row with `FOR UPDATE` ensures concurrent first-session requests
  converge before either allocates the parent group.
- DB, parent IM channel and thread IM channel cannot be one transaction. Persisting
  provisioning state and retrying create-or-update makes response loss converge
  without allocating a second parent or thread.

## Verification and boundaries

- Build, unit suite, four E2E/API shards, focused AI/message tests, `go vet`, i18n
  checks and direct WuKongIM type-17 persistence passed. Exact evidence is in
  `.octospec/tasks/my-ai-team-sessions/verification.md`.
- A migration round-trip test proves the feature does not overwrite an existing
  operator-owned `thread.auto_archive_enabled` value.
- The full pilote2e package still has an unrelated existing card-template catalog
  fixture failure; its direct WuKongIM persistence test passes.
- Client and external adapter E1-E5 remain deployment-level handoff checks; this PR
  does not claim those repositories were exercised.

## Upstream-main integration

- Merging `origin/main` at `96b3b926` brought in #846's single group-member
  admission funnel and its whole-tree source guard. The guard caught the AI
  container's intentionally atomic but direct two-row member insert.
- The integration keeps the AI association/group/session transaction intact via a
  narrow group-owned admission bridge. Before writing, the bridge locks and checks
  that the parent belongs to the requested Space and owner, has
  `purpose=ai_session_container`, and has no project binding; it then admits exactly
  the owner and Bot through the shared funnel.
- Conflict resolution in `modules/space/api.go` preserves both invariants: preset
  groups reject AI containers and project-bound groups, then use the upstream
  registered admission entry for ordinary Space-direct groups.
- Build, vet, the 52-package unit suite, all four E2E/API shards, i18n checks and the
  focused WuKongIM persistence test were rerun successfully after the merge.

## Final review hardening

- Kept mixed-collation conversion on the new AI tables, preserving indexed access
  on the legacy identity, Space and group columns; the regression fixture now uses
  realistic indexes, shipped service calls and an `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON` guard.
- Prevented org-sync events from adding or deleting AI-container members.
- Made add/re-add and session creation repair Space-cleanup membership loss through
  the shared admission funnel, reject any third member, and reconcile the parent
  plus retained session channels in WuKongIM before returning ready state.
- Prevented failed retries from overwriting ready session state and aligned rename
  locking with the agent -> session -> thread order.
- Separated product-visible group lookup from authoritative Bot lifecycle lookup,
  so deleting a User Bot also reaches its hidden AI container and is allowed to
  remove the protected Bot membership through the normal removal funnel.
- Re-ran build, vet, 52 unit packages, all four API/E2E shards, i18n checks and the
  focused WuKongIM persistence test successfully.

## Review convergence follow-up

- Added one group lifecycle-cleanup service and routed all three Bot deletion
  surfaces through it, including protected AI-container membership removal.
- Closed the remaining org-directory and category mutation/read bypasses with
  DB-backed regression coverage.
- Made AI session retention structural in `ArchiveStaleBatch`; removed the
  migration-time write that overwrote an operator's global auto-archive setting.
- Re-ran all six affected module suites plus build, vet and i18n checks on isolated
  MySQL/Redis/WuKongIM test services.

## CI asynchronous-test hardening

- E2E shard 2 showed that `space_member_removal_cleanup.attempts` advances when a
  worker claims a job, before registered cleanup callbacks execute. Waiting on that
  field did not synchronize the test with the callback or the full cascade.
- The project cascade regression now counts callback execution atomically and waits
  for the persisted release error, which is written only after every registered step
  has run. This removes both the ordering flake and the callback counter data race.
- The focused regression and the complete `modules/project` package passed with the
  CI-equivalent race detector and shuffled execution.

## Destructive lifecycle and hidden-surface closure

- The super-admin Bot deletion path now validates the persisted robot row before
  entering group cleanup, preventing a mistyped human UID from triggering a
  destructive membership cascade.
- Lifecycle cleanup preserves the shared removal primitive's intentional creator
  no-op as a warning rather than converting it into a permanent 500. New ownership
  transfers reject Bot targets, preventing creation of that unreachable owner state.
- Owner mention-preference endpoints, Bot target resolution, and manager group
  listings now reject or hide AI containers; target resolution also hides their
  thread channels.
- DB-backed focused tests and the complete affected `group`, `robot`, and `bot_api`
  packages passed, followed by build, vet, i18n, and diff gates.
- The final route-family sweep moved the incoming-webhook protection into the
  shared actor resolver after membership authorization, covering all four
  user/Bot and group/thread mounts without exposing a purpose oracle.
- The deprecated recent-conversation response and operational analytics now hide
  protected parents and session threads too, including stale analytics dimensions
  created before a group acquired the protected purpose.

## Review-fix stacked PR

- Applied the hidden-container predicate to the two shared group aggregates used
  by the manager list and statistics dashboard, keeping enumeration and totals on
  the same population.
- Initialized both page result slices so a zero-row query preserves the wire
  contract as `items: []` rather than `items: null`.
- Kept soft-deleted sessions in the durable idempotency ledger and made same-key
  replay return the existing conflict response explicitly.
- Restricted automatic title extraction to text messages. Structured content now
  uses established content-type display text, so media metadata cannot become a
  session title.
